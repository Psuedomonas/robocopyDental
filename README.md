# robocopyDental
Use robocopy for Dentrix and Dexis backup

robocopy is batch command for copying file data. The code I used would likely require the core number to be specified in order to operate.

I have included documentation for the robocopy batch command in robocopyDocumentation. The markup system for github readme.md provided to many unwanted format issues, so opted for raw text. I personally find it easier to read, and don't have to worry about the mysterious escape characters used with the .md. I'll have to investigate those later.
